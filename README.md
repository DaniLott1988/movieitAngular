6. MyFlixAngularClient

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 13.2.5.

7. Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

8. Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

9. Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

10. Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

11. Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
